To that end, we conduct online information sessions, provide scholarships to cover costs related to applications, assign participants to peer and senior mentors, and share crowdsourced documents that demystify application processes.\nIn addition to these efforts, we conduct research studies to explore and expose the barriers that affect Black junior researchers, and advocate for structural changes to remove these barriers and foster equitable research environments.\nOur program is presently designed to cover three areas of graduate education:\n Graduate application mentoring program: to support Black students seeking admission into masters and Ph.D. programs around the world. This program currently serves over 200 Black applicants in this application cycle. Graduate school mentoring: to offer guidance, mentorship, and resources for current graduate students. Postgraduate application network: to empower soon-to-be or recent Black Ph.D. students seeking postdoctoral, faculty, and research scientist positions. This program is currently serving over 100 Black applicants during this application cycle.  Since 2017, the graduate application mentoring program has served over 400 students overall, with the support of nearly 100 mentors. Participants in this program have enrolled at universities including Australian National University, University of California - Berkeley, University of British Columbia, University of Capetown, Carnegie Mellon University - Africa, University College Dublin, Cornell University, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Oxford, Stanford University, University of the Witwatersrand, and many others.\nStarting 2020, this program expanded into the Black in AI Academic Positions program, now serving current graduate students and over 100 Black junior scholars applying to postgraduate positions during the 2020/21 application cycle. Members of this program are interested in research careers in academia, industry, and policy, and previous participants have already had a significant impact in the field of AI.\nOn this page we will answer frequently asked questions and provide opportunities to advertise graduate, fellowship, postdoctoral, faculty, and research scientist positions. (See below.)\nIf you are interested in supporting us by volunteering your time as a mentor, donating to the program, or supporting us with our advocacy, please reach out to the organizers\nContact: bai-acad-team@googlegroups.com\nOrganizers:  Rediet Abebe, Ph.D., Harvard University Moses Namara, Clemson University Daniel Nkemelu, Georgia Institute of Technology Ezinne Nwankwo, Duke University  Faculty Advisors:  Rediet Abebe, Ph.D., Harvard University Sanmi Koyejo, Ph.D., University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign Dina Machuve, Ph.D., Nelson Mandela African Institute of Science and Technology Brandeis Marshall, Ph.D., Spelman College  Supported By: Black in AI\n FAQs:  How can I take part in this program?

Oral Research Presenters    Researcher Abstract     Bonolo Mathibel\nIBM Research Africa Towards Impactful Artificial Intelligence on the African Continent\nIn recent years, machine learning has been applied to solve diverse sets of challenges on the African continent. This includes reducing road traffic congestion in the face of failing road infrastructure in South Africa, drought modeling in the Horn of Africa, transfer learning for cassava disease detection in sub-Saharan Africa, and galaxy count extraction from radio telescopes. The vast majority of research conducted in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) occurs outside of the African continent, and the few studies that have been applied to the African context are based on bespoke datasets generated to solve the problem at hand. We therefore propose three pillars of representation that are foundational to achieving impactful, sustainable, and scalable AI research and product development for and on the African continent. Our aim is to increase the number of AI studies conducted in Africa and encourage researchers and AI practitioners to consider both science and impact when selecting problems to work on.   George W Musumba\nDedan Kimathi University of Technology Modelling Virtual Enterprises Using a Multi-Agent Systems Approach Nowadays enterprises work together towards a common goal by sharing responsibilities and profits as is the case for construction related projects. The construction sector’s potential contribution to the economic growth of developing countries can be enhanced if the challenges facing the sector that include delayed completion of projects, frequent collapse of buildings, lack of ethics, incompetent design, use of inappropriate materials, poor coordination and management of contractors are effectively addressed. These can be attributed to poor choice of partner enterprises for the tasks due to insufficient information available about them and lack of facilitation techniques. Selection of best partner among many for construction project is a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) process. Existing MCDM techniques cannot be used to select right partners for construction projects. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Group Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (GFAHP), MCDM algorithms that learns partner attributes (machine learning technique incorporated), were designed and applied. A Multi-Agent Systems(MAS) approach was used for simulations. The approach provide efficient decision-making support for human beings using software agents. Results show that this technique is both efficient and effective. Validation of the system, carried out by stakeholders, show that it is approximately 99.7% accurate in the evaluation and selection of partners and partners\u0026rsquo;s performance evaluation.   Charles Onu\nMcGill University Saving Newborn Lives at Birth through Machine Learning Every year, 3 million newborns die within the first month of life. Birth asphyxia and other breathing-related conditions are a leading cause of mortality during the neonatal phase. Current diagnostic methods are too sophisticated in terms of equipment, required expertise, and general logistics. Consequently, early detection of asphyxia in newborns is very difficult in many parts of the world, especially in resource-poor settings. We are developing a machine learning system, dubbed Ubenwa, which enables diagnosis of asphyxia through automated analysis of the infant cry. Deployed via smartphone and wearable technology, Ubenwa will drastically reduce the time, cost and skill required to make accurate and potentially life-saving diagnoses.   Ousmane Dia\nElementAI Adversarial Functionality-Preserving Training in the Malware Domain Multiple approaches of generating adversarial examples have been proposed to deceive deep neural networks into predicting an incorrect target for a given observation [1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10]. Most of the existing techniques that deal with images involve either computing the gradients of a loss function with respect to the images pixels [3, 7, 10], or they inject some noise generally sampled from a random or a normal distribution [1, 4, 8] into a true case in the hope that the network will take an unexpected decision. While for images, the adversarial examples are generated in a way to be identical to the true cases, the precise locations of some details in a true image may still not be preserved in the perturbed one [2]. However, exact locations of those fine details are not usually important for perceptual image recognition or validation due to images high-entropy [6]. In Security, and specifically in malware detection, however, where the cases in hand usually consist of raw bytes or sequences of system calls, this rarely holds. In Security, being able to generate new examples that preserve the functionalities (or malignant properties) of some true cases is paramount due to the difficulty of gathering large enough quantities of data for modeling purposes. We posit that the reasons the adversary generated examples may not preserve such properties are because the noise that is injected into the true cases is not necessarily sampled within the manifold of the true cases or that the gradients that are exploited are not selected in the neighborhood of the true examples.\nIn this study, we explore a new approach of generating adversarial malware cases. We make use of variational autoencoders (VAEs) (similar in spirit to [5]) to generate functionality-preserving mutations of true malware and extend Stein variational gradient descent [7] where the distribution of the latent samples are approximated using the true cases data-generating distribution. We also provide two ways to assess that the generated cases are functionality-preserving mutations of true malware: 1) by sampling sequences of bytes from the (vector representation of the) adversarial cases that we validate using as Oracle the Cuckoo Sandbox [9], and 2) by comparing specific sections of our generated mutations against true cases of malware. Because our architecture is generic enough, we evaluate our approach further with existing work on adversarial training of images and audio and compare our results.   Adji Bousso Dieng\nColumbia University A Recurrent Neural Network with Long-Range Semantic Dependency\nLanguage modeling is crucial to many NLP tasks. Applications include machine translation and speech recognition. Traditional n-gram and feed-forward neural network language models fail to capture long-range word dependencies. Previous work by Mikolov et al. has shown that adding context to a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) language model is a promising direction to solve this issue. In this talk I will briefly review traditional language models and topic models before diving into the more recent contextual RNN-based language models. In particular, I will discuss the TopicRNN model, a RNN-based language model that captures long-range semantic dependencies using topic features. I will also highlight some results on word prediction and sentiment analysis using the TopicRNN model.   Flora Ponjou Tasse\nUniversity of Cambridge ShapeSearch: A Generic Engine for 3D Models, Images, and Sketches\nWe present ShapeSearch, a generic search engine for shapes that supports queries such as 3D models, images, sketches, and text. Online repositories of images and 3D objects are growing at an exponential rate, used by growing communities of makers and artists. Moreover, the proliferation of Augmented Reality platforms is creating new communities of content creators and developers in need of 3D content. However, search features in the large 3D repositories are still limited to text. On the other hand, the research community has made significant progress in context-based shape retrieval, but current methods are typically limited to one modality such as images or sketches. We propose a generic search engine able to retrieve relevant shapes based on a wide range of modalities by leveraging the latest machine learning advances in Graphics, Vision, and NLP.

In existing interpretation methods for NLP, a word’s importance is determined by either input perturbation—measuring the decrease in model confidence when that word is removed—or by the gradient with respect to that word. To understand the limitations of these methods, we use input reduction, which iteratively removes the least important word from the input. This exposes pathological behaviors of neural models: the remaining words appear nonsensical to humans and are not the ones determined as important by interpretation methods. As we confirm with human experiments, the reduced examples lack information to support the prediction of any label, but models still make the same predictions with high confidence. To explain these counterintuitive results, we draw connections to adversarial examples and confidence calibration: pathological behaviors reveal difficulties in interpreting neural models trained with maximum likelihood. To mitigate their deficiencies, we fine-tune the models by encouraging high entropy outputs on reduced examples. Fine-tuned models become more interpretable under input reduction without accuracy loss on regular examples.\n\r## [Inioluwa Deborah Raji](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deborah-raji-065751b2/)\rTitle: \u0026ldquo;In the Shadow of Gender Shades\u0026rdquo;\nAbstract: While there have been mounting calls for algorithmic transparency as more artificial intelligence services become mainstream, and audit approaches for online platforms have been proposed, audit strategies for the effective design and disclosure of external evaluations of commercial pretrained machine learning models distributed as Application Program Interfaces (APIs) remains underdeveloped. This paper thus extends scholarship on the development and impact of black-box algorithmic auditing by exploring a real-world commercial facial analysis intersectional audit and the corporate reactions to the audit release. This paper 1) outlines the audit design and the public and private audit disclosure procedure used in the Gender Shades study, 2) presents new performance metrics from originally targeted companies T-1, T-2, T-3 on the Pilot Parliaments Benchmark as of August 2018, 3) provides performance results on PPB by non-target companies NT-A and NT-B and 4) Explores differences in company responses as shared through corporate communication.\n\r## [Justice Amoh](http://justiceamoh.github.io/)\rTitle: \u0026ldquo;An Optimized Recurrent Unit for Ultra-Low Power Acoustic Event Detection\u0026rdquo;\nAbstract: Currently, there is a demand for neural network models that can run on sensors, wearables and IoT devices. However, resource constraints of such edge devices make it challenging to realize on-device neural network inferencing. For ultra-low power wearable applications, there are no practical solutions for deploying neural networks. To meet this need, our work introduces a new recurrent unit architecture that is specifically adapted for on-device low-power acoustic event detection (AED). The proposed embedded Gated Recurrent Unit (eGRU) is based on the GRU architecture but features optimizations that make it implementable on ultra-low power micro-controllers such as the ARM Cortex M0+. With our proposed modifications, eGRU is demonstrated to be effective, especially for short duration AED and keyword spotting tasks. A single eGRU cell is 60x faster and 12x smaller than a GRU cell. Despite its optimizations, eGRU compares well with conventional GRU across AED tasks of different complexities.\n\r## [Kehinde Owoeye](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/people/K.Owoeye.html/)\rTitle: \u0026ldquo;Identifying sheep with abnormal movement trajectory in a flock\u0026rdquo;\nAbstract: Learning to identify anomalies in the behavior of individuals is becoming increasingly important for a variety of reasons for example in studying the progression of several diseases. Due to the need to assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions, animals with longer life span are becoming increasingly important for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions. In this presentation, I will describe computational methods that allow for the automatic discrimination of sheep with a genetic mutation that causes Batten disease from an age-matched control group, using GPS movement traces as input. Batten disease is a neurodegenerative disease with symptoms that are likely to affect the way that those with it move and socialize, including loss of vision and dementia. The distance covered in each ten minute period and, more specifically, outliers in each period, are used as the basis for identification. Our results show that, despite the variability in the sample, the bulk of the outliers during the period of observation came from the sheep with Batten disease. Our results, though preliminary, point towards the potential of using relatively simple movement metrics in identifying the onset of a phenotype in symptomatically similar conditions.\n\r## [Lucio Dery](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucio-dery/)\rTitle: \u0026ldquo;Audio to Body Dynamics\u0026rdquo;\nAbstract: We present a method that gets as input an audio of violin or piano playing, and outputs a video of skeleton predictions which are further used to animate an avatar. The key idea is to create an animation of an avatar that moves their hands similarly to how a pianist or violinist would do, just from audio. Aiming for a fully detailed correct arms and fingers motion is a goal, however, it’s not clear if body movement can be predicted from music at all. In this paper, we present the first result that shows that natural body dynamics can be predicted at all. We built an LSTM network that is trained on violin and piano recital videos uploaded to the Internet. The predicted points are applied onto a rigged avatar to create the animation.\n\r## [Obioma Pelka](https://www.fh-dortmund.de/pelka/)\rTitle: \u0026ldquo;Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO): A Multimodal Medical Image Dataset\u0026rdquo;\nAbstract: This work introduces a new multimodal image dataset, with the aim of detecting the interplay between visual elements and semantic relations present in radiology images. The objective is accomplished by retrieving all image-caption pairs from the open-access biomedical literature database PubMedCentral, as these captions describe the visual content in their semantic context. The target domain being radiology, all compound, multi-pane, and non-radiology images were eliminated using an automatic binary classifier fine-tuned with a deep convolutional neural network system and trained with datasets distributed at the medical tasks of ImageCLEF 2013, 2015 and 2016. The Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) dataset contains over 81k radiology images with several medical imaging modalities including Computer Tomography (CT), Ultrasound, X-Ray, Fluoroscopy, Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Mammography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Angiography and PET-CT. For all images in ROCO, the corresponding caption, keywords, Unified Medical Language Systems (UMLS) Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) and Semantic Type will be distributed. An additional out-of-class set with 6k images ranging from synthetic radiology figures to digital arts is provided, to improve prediction and classification performance of out-of-class samples. Adopting ROCO, systems for caption and keywords generation can be modeled, which enables multimodal representation for image datasets lacking text representation. Furthermore, systems with the goal of image structuring and semantic information tagging can be created using ROCO, which is beneficial and of assistance for image and information retrieval purposes.\n\r## [Raesetje Sefala](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raesetje-sefala-2b9393119/)\rTitle: \u0026ldquo;Using satellite images and computer vision to study the evolution and effects of spatial apartheid in South Africa\u0026rdquo;\nAbstract: One of the main problems in South Africa is removing many of the legacies of Apartheid - a former policy of economic and political discrimination, and segregation against non-European groups in South Africa. For example, moving around residential areas shows the legacy of spatial apartheid on a smaller scale- completely segregated neighborhoods of townships next to gated wealthy neighborhoods that have largely remained unaffected by the ending of apartheid. Our research proposes to use computer vision to analyze millions of such satellite images of South Africa from 2006 to 2016. This work aims to use satellite images, geographically labelled coordinates of South Africa\u0026rsquo;s built environment and socioeconomic data to understand the relationship between the spatial and socioeconomic makeup of neighborhoods in South Africa, and study how they have evolved over time post Apartheid. We propose a semantic segmentation model to detect and classify clusters of townships and wealthy areas from these high resolution satellite images. In addition to automatically detecting and classifying neighborhoods, we plan to use demographic and socioeconomic data to then analyze the change over time in the demographic makeup, economic status and access to basic resources such as the number of clinics and schools of these detected neighborhoods.\n\r## [Randi Williams](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/randiw12/overview/)\rTitle: \u0026ldquo;PopBots: Leveraging Social Robots to Aid Early Childhood Artificial Intelligence Education\u0026rdquo;\nAbstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing our lives, impacting the way that even the youngest members of society live, learn, and play. Previous work examining children’s relationships with AI has shown that this population lacks an understanding of how AI devices work. This lack of understanding makes it difficult for children to engage in safe and constructive interactions with their smart playthings. Furthermore, as this technology becomes more pervasive, we must think about how to build a diverse workforce that creates technology to equitably address the needs of many. Given these motivations, we designed an early childhood AI curriculum, PopBots. PopBots is a hands-on toolkit that enables young children to learn about AI by programming and training a social robot. We evaluated the toolkit with 80 preschool children (ages 4-6) and found that the use of a social robot as a learning companion and programmable artifact was effective. Children could correctly answer questions about knowledge-based systems, supervised machine learning, and generative music algorithms. Additionally, we found that using the toolkit helped children better appreciate the cognitive capabilities of robots. We will discuss the toolkit and teaching methods used in hope that this first exploration into early AI education will inspire other educators and researchers.\n\r## [Sicelukwanda Zwane](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sicelukwanda-zwane-54873398/)\rTitle: \u0026ldquo;Safer Exploration in Deep Reinforcement Learning using Action Priors\u0026rdquo;\nAbstract: Behavior learning in deep reinforcement learning is inherently unsafe because untrained agents typically have to sample actions from randomly initialized task policies and from random exploration policies. Executing these actions in physical environments can lead agents to harmful states, possibly causing damage and poor initial performance. In this work, we address this problem by using transfer learning to develop a framework for safer reinforcement learning in continuous environments. We show that our exploration policy results in fewer collisions with the environment, better initial performance, and earlier convergence compared to the vanilla epsilon-greedy random exploration policy.\n\r## [Tewodros Abebe Gebreselassie](https://github.com/TewodrosAbebe)\rTitle: \u0026ldquo;Parallel Corpora for bi-Directional Statistical Machine Translation for Seven Ethiopian Language Pairs\u0026rdquo;\nAbstract: In this paper, we describe the development of parallel corpora for Ethiopian Languages: Amharic, Tigrigna, Afan-Oromo, Wolaytta and Ge’ez. To check the usability of all the corpora we used them to conduct a baseline bi-directional statistical machine translation experiment for seven language pairs. The bi-directional SMT BLEU score shows that all the corpora can be used for further SMT investigations. We have also learnt that the morphological richness of the Ethio-Semitic languages has a negative impact on the performance of the SMT especially when they are target languages. Now we are working towards selecting an optimal alignment for bi-directional statistical machine translation among the Ethiopian languages.\nAccepted Posters    Name of presenter Title of Poster     Bitseat Tadesse Aragaw Sentence Level Amharic Text Sentiment Analysis Model: A Combined Approach   Bitseat Tadesse Aragaw Sentence Level Amharic Text Sentiment Analysis Model: A Combined Approach   Wathela Alhassan The FIRST Classifier: compact and extended radio galaxy classification using deep Convolutional Neural Networks   Neema Mduma Evaluation of Imbalanced Data Techniques for Student Dropout Prediction   Neema Mduma Evaluation of Imbalanced Data Techniques for Student Dropout Prediction   Oyebo Abdulhamiid Bankole PLANT LEAVES CLASSIFICATION USING K-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR ALGORITHM   Geletaw Sahle Tegenaw A machine learning approach for identifying proteins involved in conserved parasite- mosquito interactions   Bruno Ssekiwere A Blended Approach of Machine Learning Techniques in Predicting Vegetation Cover   Semakula Abdumajidhu Sootymold effect on cassava yields using convolutional neural networks.

Recently, we have seen the development of models that contain substantial social biases, as well as models ripe for potential misuse in relation to neural disinformation. In this lecture, I examine how creative technologists, researchers in the digital humanities, and machine learning researchers can work together to develop more robust defenses. I discuss how a deep understanding of historical context can inform current socio-political impacts of neural disinformation and bias in machine learning models. I then highlight research that operationalizes these models, and discuss how we might foster critical interactions between research fields to combat bias and misuse moving forward.\nBio: Matthew Kenney is a researcher, developer, and designer.

Most notably, the RCNN series and SSD have brought about profound developments by using convolutional neural networks. However, real world use cases such as robotics and autonomous vehicles do not guarantee ideal lighting conditions for these algorithms to perform at full capacity. This demand, propelled by the explosion of sensors and computing power, has led to the development of robust algorithms capable of estimating the position of objects based on measurements from multiple sensors. In this paper, we summarize the gain and limitations of augmenting color images from a regular camera with depth information from LIDARs. This is an ongoing research to identify and rectify shortcomings in image based object detection algorithms with emphasis on self-driving cars.\n\rAbeba Birhane Presentation Format: \u0026ldquo;Contributed talk at the BAI Workshop\u0026rdquo;\nAuthors: Abeba Birhane (University College Dublin)*; Fred Cummins (University College Dublin )\nTitle of Presentation: Algorithmic Injustices: Towards a Relational Ethics\nAbstract: Decision-making processes in various social, political, and economical spheres are increasingly assisted by algorithmic systems. Improved efficiency, the hallmark of these systems, drives the mass scale integration of algorithmic systems into daily life. However, as a robust body of research in the area of algorithmic injustice shows [1], [2], [3], algorithmic tools embed and perpetuate societal and historical injustice. A persistent recurring trend within the literature indicates that society’s most vulnerable are disproportionally impacted. When algorithmic unfairness is brought to the fore, most of the solutions on offer 1) revolve around technical solutions and 2) do not centre disproportionally impacted groups. This paper zooms out and draws the bigger picture. It 1) argues that concerns surrounding algorithmic decision making and algorithmic injustice require fundamental rethinking above and beyond technical solutions, and 2) outlines a way forward in a manner that centres vulnerable groups through the lens of relational ethics.\n\rNeema Mduma Presentation Format: \u0026ldquo;Contributed talk at the BAI Workshop\u0026rdquo;\nAuthors: Neema Mduma (The Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology)*; Khamisi Kalegele (Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology); Dina Machuve (The Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology)\nTitle of Presentation: An Ensemble Predictive Model Based Prototype for Student Drop-out in Secondary Schools\nAbstract: When a student is absent from school for a continuous number of days as defined by the relevant authority, that student is considered to have dropped out of school. In Tanzania, for instance, drop-out is when a student is absent continuously for a period of 90 days. Despite the fact that several efforts have been made to improve the overall status of education at secondary level, the student drop-out problem still persists. Taking advantage of advancement in technology, several studies have used machine learning to address the student drop-out problem. However, most of the conducted studies have used datasets from developed countries, while developing countries are facing challenges on generating public datasets to be used to address this problem. Using a dataset from Tanzania which reflect a local scenario; this study presents an ensemble predictive model based prototype for student drop-out in secondary schools. The deployed model was developed by soft combining a tuned Logistic Regression and Multi-Layer Perceptron models. A feature engineering experiment was conducted to obtain the most important features for predicting student drop-out. Furthermore, a visualization module was integrated to assist interpretation of the machine learning results and we used a flask framework in the development of the prototype.\n\rIsrael Birhane Presentation Format: \u0026ldquo;Contributed talk at the BAI Workshop\u0026rdquo;\nAuthors: Israel Birhane (Mila)*\nTitle of Presentation: Nanoscale Microscopy Images Colourization Using Neural Networks\nAbstract: Grey microscopy images are powerful tools and widely used in major research areas, such as biology, chemistry, physics, and materials fields. However, most of the microscopy images are colorless due to the special imaging mechanism. For example, SEM produces images by scanning the surface of the sample with a focused beam of electrons, while AFM measures the forces between the probe and the sample as a function of their mutual separation. Though investigating on some popular solutions proposed recently about colorizing microscopy images, we notice the process of those methods are usually tedious, complicated, and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce two neural networks for gray microscopy image colorization:\n An End-to-End convolutional neural network (CNN) with a pre-trained Inception ResNetV2 model for feature extraction. 2.A Neural Style Transfer convolutional neural network (NST-CNN), which can colorize grey microscopy images with semantic information learned from a user-provided color image at inference time. Our experiments show that our algorithm could able to color the microscopy images under complex circumstances precisely.  \rRobert Ness Presentation Format: \u0026ldquo;Contributed talk at the BAI Workshop\u0026rdquo;\nAuthors: Robert Ness (Gamalon Inc.), Kaushal Paneri (Northeastern University), Olga Vitek (Northeastern University)\nTitle of Presentation: Integrating Markov processes with structural causal modeling enables counterfactual inference in complex systems\nAbstract: This manuscript contributes a general and practical framework for casting a Markov process model of a system at equilibrium as a structural causal model, and carrying out counterfactual inference. Markov processes mathematically describe the mechanisms in the system, and predict the system’s equilibrium behavior upon intervention, but do not support counterfactual inference. In contrast, structural causal models support counterfactual inference, but do not identify the mechanisms. This manuscript leverages the benefits of both approaches. We define the structural causal models in terms of the parameters and the equilibrium dynamics of the Markov process models, and counterfactual inference flows from these settings. The proposed approach alleviates the identifiability drawback of the structural causal models, in that the counterfactual inference is consistent with the counter- factual trajectories simulated from the Markov process model. We showcase the benefits of this framework in case studies of complex biomolecular systems with nonlinear dynamics. We illustrate that, in presence of Markov process model misspecification, counterfactual inference leverages prior data, and therefore estimates the outcome of an intervention more accurately than a direct simulation.\n\rFolake Akinbohun Presentation Format: \u0026ldquo;Contributed talk at the BAI Workshop\u0026rdquo;\nAuthors: Folake Akinbohun (Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo)*; Olatubosun Olabode (The Federal University of Technology, Akure); Adetunmbi A.O (Department of computer science Federal University of Technology, Akure Ondo state.

Most African patients with head and neck cancer present to primary care centres but the inability of the health workers to promptly refer them to the specialists for further diagnostic workup is difficult, thereby causing late referral with resultant poor prognosis (Allgar and Neal, 2005), there is a need to develop a system for easy diagnosis so that there would be prompt referral to the ENT (oto-rhino-laryngologist) specialist(s). METHOD: Developing stacked ensemble models for diagnosing Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) involves synthesized clinical data, feature selection, base level models and stacked ensemble models. The raw data were obtained from southwest hospitals in Nigeria where case notes of all histopathologically confirmed Head/Neck cancers were retrieved from medical records of the observed hospitals. The dataset consists of 1473 records and 18 features. Filter methods of feature selection are deployed where information gain and consistency are used to remove redundant and irrelevant features from the dataset. Stacked ensemble model consists of two phases: In the first phase, training of the base learners where Decision tree C4.5, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes machine learning algorithms are used to build the base classifiers. The second phase is the training of meta level where Multinominal logistic regression (MLR) is used as the meta level algorithm.\n\rRahel Tamiru Presentation Format: \u0026ldquo;Contributed talk at the BAI Workshop\u0026rdquo;\nAuthors: Rahel Tamiru (Bahir Dar Universty)*\nTitle of Presentation: Prosody Based Automatic Speech Segmentation for Amharic\nAbstract: The main goal of this work is to develop sentence level automatic speech segmentation system for Amharic. Sentence segmentation is a process of identifying the end of a sentence. In this study, sentence segmentation system is implemented in to two approaches. In the first approach, we used an automatic tool for segmenting and labeling of Amharic speech data. Acoustic model is created using speech and their text scripts and compiling them into a statistical representation of sounds which makeup words. This is done through HMM modeling. The approach one automatic speech segmentation system is done by forced alignment. In this approach we used rule-based and AdaBoost to discriminate the true boundaries from false. In the second approach, we extracted prosodic features directly from speech waveform and also statistical method, AdaBoost, is used.\nThe evaluation of the experiments shows that monosyllable acoustic model is the better model to get accurate forced alignment than monophone and tide state tri-syllable model. And also adaboost classifier showed consistently good results especially in decision tree classifier. In all experiment read-aloud speech perform higher accuracy than spontaneous speech. It also indicates that spontaneous speech is more difficult than read-aloud because, the spontaneous speech contains more noise and disfluencies. The evaluation in phase two indicates that pause feature is a basic discriminator for Amharic sentence boundary. And also when prosodic features are introduced, the performance is increased. The scope of the research work is narrowed down only to sentences level segmentation. It is also required to conduct a research on automatic speech segmentation of other discrete units.\n\rWilka Carvalho Presentation Format: \u0026ldquo;Contributed talk at the BAI Workshop\u0026rdquo;\nAuthors: Wilka Carvalho (University of Michigan\u0026ndash;Ann Arbor), Kimin Lee (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), Richard Lewis (University of Michigan\u0026ndash;Ann Arbor), Satinder Singh (University of Michigan\u0026ndash;Ann Arbor/Deepmind) and Honglak Lee (University of Michigan\u0026ndash;Ann Arbor/Google Brain)\nTitle of Presentation: Efficiently Learning to Perform Household Tasks with Object-Oriented Exploration\nAbstract: Human perception and decision making are centered around perceiving objects and interacting with them. Remarkably, humans enter environments without knowledge of the objects or categories they will encounter and learn spatially invariant representations for novel object-categories as they explore object-interactions that fulfill their goals. Yet much work in deep reinforcement learning (RL) that requires explicit object-interaction has avoided the object perception problem and provided agents with a priori knowledge of the objects they will interact with. In this work, we explore how an RL agent without a priori knowledge of environment objects can efficiently learn to perform complex object-oriented tasks by learning invariant object-category representations. We propose a novel self-supervised object-memory module that leverages interactions with objects to learn a view-invariant object recognition function. We exploit this view-invariance by combining it with count-based exploration to enable object-oriented exploration. This enables our agent to explore among object-interactions instead of among all state-action pairs. In order to evaluate our method, we introduce a set of challenging tasks in the AI2Thor 3D-home environment and show that our approach enables sample-efficient learning of complex, object-oriented RL tasks.\n\rAccepted Posters \r  A Blended Approach of Machine Learning Techniques in Predicting Vegetation Cover Bruno Ssekiwere (Uganda Technology and Management U.); Timothy Kivumbi (Uganda Technology and Management U.)\n  Transfer Learning for ECG-based Virtual Pathology Stethoscope Tracking Haben G Yhdego (Old Dominion U.)\n  An Ensemble Predictive Model Based Prototype for Student Drop-out in Secondary Schools Neema Mduma (NMIST); Khamisi Kalegele (Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology); Dina Machuve (NMIST)\n  Classifying Malware by their Behavior Using API System Calls Allan Ninyesiga (Uganda Technology and Management U.)\n  A Predictive Model for Classifying Post Treatment Mortality Rate of Breast Cancer Patients Sakinat O Folorunso (Olabisi Onabanjo U.)\n  From Stroke to Finite Automata: An Offline Recognition Approach Kehinde Aruleba (U. of the Witwatersrand)\n  Unsupervised Similarity Based Topic Segmentation System for Amharic Abey D Melles (US Embassy)\n  Prediction of Postures on a Smart Chair Tariku A Gelaw (Ethiopian Biotechnology Inst.)\n  Models for Predicting Global Solar Radiation Using Artificial Neural Network Stephen G Fashoto (U. of Swaziland)\n  Dictionary Based Amharic Sentiment Lexicon Construction Girma Neshir N Alemneh (Addis Ababa U.); Solomon Atnafu (Addis Ababa U.); Andreas Rauber (TU Wien)\n  Applying Machine Learning Algorithms for Kidney Disease Diagnosis Yenatfanta S Bayleyegn (Ethiopian Biotechnology Inst.); Meron Alemayehu (Ethiopian Biotechnology Inst.)\n  Banana Diseases Detection using Deep Learning Sophia Leonard Sanga (NMIST); Kennedy Jomanga (International Inst. of Tropical Agriculture); Dina Machuve (NMIST)\n  Corpora Development for Igbo Sentiment Lexicons Emeka Ogbuju (Federal U.

If properly mined and filtered, these data can be combined with environmental, socioeconomic and epidemiologic data for understanding disease and health patterns, as well as the relationship between human behavior and disease spread. In this talk, Dr. Nsoesie will discuss the nascent field of digital epidemiology and present examples on the use of digital data (e.g., social media, Internet news, business and product reviews) and machine learning for monitoring infectious diseases, unsafe food products and risk factors for obesity.\nBio: Dr. Nsoesie is an Assistant Professor of Global Health at Boston University (BU) School of Public Health. She is also a BU Data Science Faculty Fellow as part of the BU Data Science Initiative at the Hariri Institute for Computing and a Data and Innovation Fellow at The Directorate of Science, Technology and Innovation (DSTI) in the Office of the President in Sierra Leone. Dr. Nsoesie applies data science methodologies to global health problems, using digital data and technology to improve health, particularly in the realm of surveillance of chronic and infectious diseases. She has worked with local public health departments in the United States and international organizations, such as UNICEF, Brazil Ministry of Health and the Surgo Foundation. She completed her postdoctoral studies at Harvard Medical School, and her PhD in Computational Epidemiology from the Genetics, Bioinformatics and Computational Biology program at Virginia Tech.

Recently, we have seen the development of models that contain substantial social biases, as well as models ripe for potential misuse in relation to neural disinformation. In this lecture, I examine how creative technologists, researchers in the digital humanities, and machine learning researchers can work together to develop more robust defenses. I discuss how a deep understanding of historical context can inform current socio-political impacts of neural disinformation and bias in machine learning models. I then highlight research that operationalizes these models, and discuss how we might foster critical interactions between research fields to combat bias and misuse moving forward.\nBio: Matthew Kenney is a researcher, developer, and designer.

Most notably, the RCNN series and SSD have brought about profound developments by using convolutional neural networks. However, real world use cases such as robotics and autonomous vehicles do not guarantee ideal lighting conditions for these algorithms to perform at full capacity. This demand, propelled by the explosion of sensors and computing power, has led to the development of robust algorithms capable of estimating the position of objects based on measurements from multiple sensors. In this paper, we summarize the gain and limitations of augmenting color images from a regular camera with depth information from LIDARs. This is an ongoing research to identify and rectify shortcomings in image based object detection algorithms with emphasis on self-driving cars.\n\r## Abeba Birhane\rPresentation Format: \u0026ldquo;Contributed talk at the BAI Workshop\u0026rdquo;\nAuthors: Abeba Birhane (University College Dublin)*; Fred Cummins (University College Dublin )\nTitle of Presentation: Algorithmic Injustices: Towards a Relational Ethics\nAbstract: Decision-making processes in various social, political, and economical spheres are increasingly assisted by algorithmic systems. Improved efficiency, the hallmark of these systems, drives the mass scale integration of algorithmic systems into daily life. However, as a robust body of research in the area of algorithmic injustice shows [1], [2], [3], algorithmic tools embed and perpetuate societal and historical injustice. A persistent recurring trend within the literature indicates that society’s most vulnerable are disproportionally impacted. When algorithmic unfairness is brought to the fore, most of the solutions on offer 1) revolve around technical solutions and 2) do not centre disproportionally impacted groups. This paper zooms out and draws the bigger picture. It 1) argues that concerns surrounding algorithmic decision making and algorithmic injustice require fundamental rethinking above and beyond technical solutions, and 2) outlines a way forward in a manner that centres vulnerable groups through the lens of relational ethics.\n\r## Neema Mduma\rPresentation Format: \u0026ldquo;Contributed talk at the BAI Workshop\u0026rdquo;\nAuthors: Neema Mduma (The Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology)*; Khamisi Kalegele (Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology); Dina Machuve (The Nelson Mandela African Institution of Science and Technology)\nTitle of Presentation: An Ensemble Predictive Model Based Prototype for Student Drop-out in Secondary Schools\nAbstract: When a student is absent from school for a continuous number of days as defined by the relevant authority, that student is considered to have dropped out of school. In Tanzania, for instance, drop-out is when a student is absent continuously for a period of 90 days. Despite the fact that several efforts have been made to improve the overall status of education at secondary level, the student drop-out problem still persists. Taking advantage of advancement in technology, several studies have used machine learning to address the student drop-out problem. However, most of the conducted studies have used datasets from developed countries, while developing countries are facing challenges on generating public datasets to be used to address this problem. Using a dataset from Tanzania which reflect a local scenario; this study presents an ensemble predictive model based prototype for student drop-out in secondary schools. The deployed model was developed by soft combining a tuned Logistic Regression and Multi-Layer Perceptron models. A feature engineering experiment was conducted to obtain the most important features for predicting student drop-out. Furthermore, a visualization module was integrated to assist interpretation of the machine learning results and we used a flask framework in the development of the prototype.\n\r## Israel Birhane\rPresentation Format: \u0026ldquo;Contributed talk at the BAI Workshop\u0026rdquo;\nAuthors: Israel Birhane (Mila)*\nTitle of Presentation: Nanoscale Microscopy Images Colourization Using Neural Networks\nAbstract: Grey microscopy images are powerful tools and widely used in major research areas, such as biology, chemistry, physics, and materials fields. However, most of the microscopy images are colorless due to the special imaging mechanism. For example, SEM produces images by scanning the surface of the sample with a focused beam of electrons, while AFM measures the forces between the probe and the sample as a function of their mutual separation. Though investigating on some popular solutions proposed recently about colorizing microscopy images, we notice the process of those methods are usually tedious, complicated, and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce two neural networks for gray microscopy image colorization:\n An End-to-End convolutional neural network (CNN) with a pre-trained Inception ResNetV2 model for feature extraction. 2.A Neural Style Transfer convolutional neural network (NST-CNN), which can colorize grey microscopy images with semantic information learned from a user-provided color image at inference time. Our experiments show that our algorithm could able to color the microscopy images under complex circumstances precisely.  \r## Robert Ness\rPresentation Format: \u0026ldquo;Contributed talk at the BAI Workshop\u0026rdquo;\nAuthors: Robert Ness (Gamalon Inc.), Kaushal Paneri (Northeastern University), Olga Vitek (Northeastern University)\nTitle of Presentation: Integrating Markov processes with structural causal modeling enables counterfactual inference in complex systems\nAbstract: This manuscript contributes a general and practical framework for casting a Markov process model of a system at equilibrium as a structural causal model, and carrying out counterfactual inference. Markov processes mathematically describe the mechanisms in the system, and predict the system’s equilibrium behavior upon intervention, but do not support counterfactual inference. In contrast, structural causal models support counterfactual inference, but do not identify the mechanisms. This manuscript leverages the benefits of both approaches. We define the structural causal models in terms of the parameters and the equilibrium dynamics of the Markov process models, and counterfactual inference flows from these settings. The proposed approach alleviates the identifiability drawback of the structural causal models, in that the counterfactual inference is consistent with the counter- factual trajectories simulated from the Markov process model. We showcase the benefits of this framework in case studies of complex biomolecular systems with nonlinear dynamics. We illustrate that, in presence of Markov process model misspecification, counterfactual inference leverages prior data, and therefore estimates the outcome of an intervention more accurately than a direct simulation.\n\r## Folake Akinbohun\rPresentation Format: \u0026ldquo;Contributed talk at the BAI Workshop\u0026rdquo;\nAuthors: Folake Akinbohun (Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo)*; Olatubosun Olabode (The Federal University of Technology, Akure); Adetunmbi A.O (Department of computer science Federal University of Technology, Akure Ondo state.

Most African patients with head and neck cancer present to primary care centres but the inability of the health workers to promptly refer them to the specialists for further diagnostic workup is difficult, thereby causing late referral with resultant poor prognosis (Allgar and Neal, 2005), there is a need to develop a system for easy diagnosis so that there would be prompt referral to the ENT (oto-rhino-laryngologist) specialist(s). METHOD: Developing stacked ensemble models for diagnosing Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) involves synthesized clinical data, feature selection, base level models and stacked ensemble models. The raw data were obtained from southwest hospitals in Nigeria where case notes of all histopathologically confirmed Head/Neck cancers were retrieved from medical records of the observed hospitals. The dataset consists of 1473 records and 18 features. Filter methods of feature selection are deployed where information gain and consistency are used to remove redundant and irrelevant features from the dataset. Stacked ensemble model consists of two phases: In the first phase, training of the base learners where Decision tree C4.5, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naïve Bayes machine learning algorithms are used to build the base classifiers. The second phase is the training of meta level where Multinominal logistic regression (MLR) is used as the meta level algorithm.\n\r## Rahel Tamiru\rPresentation Format: \u0026ldquo;Contributed talk at the BAI Workshop\u0026rdquo;\nAuthors: Rahel Tamiru (Bahir Dar Universty)*\nTitle of Presentation: Prosody Based Automatic Speech Segmentation for Amharic\nAbstract: The main goal of this work is to develop sentence level automatic speech segmentation system for Amharic. Sentence segmentation is a process of identifying the end of a sentence. In this study, sentence segmentation system is implemented in to two approaches. In the first approach, we used an automatic tool for segmenting and labeling of Amharic speech data. Acoustic model is created using speech and their text scripts and compiling them into a statistical representation of sounds which makeup words. This is done through HMM modeling. The approach one automatic speech segmentation system is done by forced alignment. In this approach we used rule-based and AdaBoost to discriminate the true boundaries from false. In the second approach, we extracted prosodic features directly from speech waveform and also statistical method, AdaBoost, is used.\nThe evaluation of the experiments shows that monosyllable acoustic model is the better model to get accurate forced alignment than monophone and tide state tri-syllable model. And also adaboost classifier showed consistently good results especially in decision tree classifier. In all experiment read-aloud speech perform higher accuracy than spontaneous speech. It also indicates that spontaneous speech is more difficult than read-aloud because, the spontaneous speech contains more noise and disfluencies. The evaluation in phase two indicates that pause feature is a basic discriminator for Amharic sentence boundary. And also when prosodic features are introduced, the performance is increased. The scope of the research work is narrowed down only to sentences level segmentation. It is also required to conduct a research on automatic speech segmentation of other discrete units.\n\r## Wilka Carvalho\rPresentation Format: \u0026ldquo;Contributed talk at the BAI Workshop\u0026rdquo;\nAuthors: Wilka Carvalho (University of Michigan\u0026ndash;Ann Arbor), Kimin Lee (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), Richard Lewis (University of Michigan\u0026ndash;Ann Arbor), Satinder Singh (University of Michigan\u0026ndash;Ann Arbor/Deepmind) and Honglak Lee (University of Michigan\u0026ndash;Ann Arbor/Google Brain)\nTitle of Presentation: Efficiently Learning to Perform Household Tasks with Object-Oriented Exploration\nAbstract: Human perception and decision making are centered around perceiving objects and interacting with them. Remarkably, humans enter environments without knowledge of the objects or categories they will encounter and learn spatially invariant representations for novel object-categories as they explore object-interactions that fulfill their goals. Yet much work in deep reinforcement learning (RL) that requires explicit object-interaction has avoided the object perception problem and provided agents with a priori knowledge of the objects they will interact with. In this work, we explore how an RL agent without a priori knowledge of environment objects can efficiently learn to perform complex object-oriented tasks by learning invariant object-category representations. We propose a novel self-supervised object-memory module that leverages interactions with objects to learn a view-invariant object recognition function. We exploit this view-invariance by combining it with count-based exploration to enable object-oriented exploration. This enables our agent to explore among object-interactions instead of among all state-action pairs. In order to evaluate our method, we introduce a set of challenging tasks in the AI2Thor 3D-home environment and show that our approach enables sample-efficient learning of complex, object-oriented RL tasks.\n\rAccepted Posters \r  A Blended Approach of Machine Learning Techniques in Predicting Vegetation Cover Bruno Ssekiwere (Uganda Technology and Management U.); Timothy Kivumbi (Uganda Technology and Management U.)\n  Transfer Learning for ECG-based Virtual Pathology Stethoscope Tracking Haben G Yhdego (Old Dominion U.)\n  An Ensemble Predictive Model Based Prototype for Student Drop-out in Secondary Schools Neema Mduma (NMIST); Khamisi Kalegele (Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology); Dina Machuve (NMIST)\n  Classifying Malware by their Behavior Using API System Calls Allan Ninyesiga (Uganda Technology and Management U.)\n  A Predictive Model for Classifying Post Treatment Mortality Rate of Breast Cancer Patients Sakinat O Folorunso (Olabisi Onabanjo U.)\n  From Stroke to Finite Automata: An Offline Recognition Approach Kehinde Aruleba (U. of the Witwatersrand)\n  Unsupervised Similarity Based Topic Segmentation System for Amharic Abey D Melles (US Embassy)\n  Prediction of Postures on a Smart Chair Tariku A Gelaw (Ethiopian Biotechnology Inst.)\n  Models for Predicting Global Solar Radiation Using Artificial Neural Network Stephen G Fashoto (U. of Swaziland)\n  Dictionary Based Amharic Sentiment Lexicon Construction Girma Neshir N Alemneh (Addis Ababa U.); Solomon Atnafu (Addis Ababa U.); Andreas Rauber (TU Wien)\n  Applying Machine Learning Algorithms for Kidney Disease Diagnosis Yenatfanta S Bayleyegn (Ethiopian Biotechnology Inst.); Meron Alemayehu (Ethiopian Biotechnology Inst.)\n  Banana Diseases Detection using Deep Learning Sophia Leonard Sanga (NMIST); Kennedy Jomanga (International Inst. of Tropical Agriculture); Dina Machuve (NMIST)\n  Corpora Development for Igbo Sentiment Lexicons Emeka Ogbuju (Federal U.
