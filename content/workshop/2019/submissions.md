We welcome works in artificial intelligence, including, but not limited to, computer vision, deep learning, knowledge reasoning, machine learning, multi-agent systems, natural language processing, statistical reasoning, theory, robotics, as well as applications of AI to other domains such as health and education, and submissions concerning fairness, ethics, and transparency in AI. Papers may introduce new theory, methodology, or applications.

We also welcome position papers and demos related to these areas. Work may be previously published, completed, or ongoing. Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 2 reviewers in the area. The workshop will not publish proceedings. We encourage all Black researchers in the field to submit their work, and do not need to be first author of the work. 

### Formatting instructions
Submissions must be in PDF format and are limited to two content pages, including all figures and tables. An additional page containing only references is allowed. Submissions should be in a __single column__, typeset using __11-point__ or larger fonts and have at least __1-inch margin__ all around. 

Submissions that __do not__ follow these guidelines risk being rejected without consideration of their merits. 

### Double-blinded reviews
Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 2 reviewers, in addition to an area chair. The reviewing process will be double-blinded at the level of the reviewers. As an author, you are responsible for anonymizing your submission. In particular, you should not include author names, author affiliations, or acknowledgements in your submission and you should avoid providing any other identifying information.
