### Black in AI 2019: Call for Submissions
<span style="color:red">__The deadline for submissions has officially passed!__</span>

We invite submissions for the Third Black in AI Workshop (co-located with [NeurIPS 2019](https://nips.cc/) at the [Vancouver Convention Center, Vancouver CANADA](https://www.vancouverconventioncentre.com/). We welcome research work in artificial intelligence, computational neuroscience, and its applications. 

These include, but are not limited to, deep learning,  knowledge reasoning, machine learning, multi-agent systems, statistical reasoning, theory, computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, as well as applications of AI to other domains such as health and education, and submissions concerning fairness, ethics, and transparency in AI.

Papers may introduce new theory, methodology, applications or product demonstrations. We also welcome position papers that synthesize existing work, identify future directions, or inform on neglected/abandoned areas where AI could be impactful. Examples are work on AI & Arts, AI & Policy, etc.

Each submission will fall into one of these 4 tracks:

* Machine learning Algorithms
* Applications of AI 
* Position papers
* Product demonstrations

Work may be previously published, completed, or ongoing. The workshop will not publish proceedings. We encourage all Black researchers in areas related to AI to submit their work. They need not to be first author of the work.

### Invited talks 
The workshop will feature invited talks from prominent researchers and practitioners, oral presentations, and a poster session. There will also be socials to facilitate networking, discussion of different career opportunities in AI, and sharing of ideas to increase participation of Black researchers in the field. We invite all members of the AI community to attend the workshop. 

### Registration
The early registration deadline for the conference is __Sun October 13, 2019 11:59 EST:__. We strongly encourage workshop attendees to register for the workshops as early as possible. The registration can be found [here](https://nips.cc/accounts/login/?next=/Profile).
