# Submission Instructions

<!---
<span style="color:red">__The deadline for submissions has officially passed!__</span>
-->
We welcome works in artificial intelligence, including, but not limited to, computer vision, deep learning, knowledge reasoning, machine learning, multi-agent systems, natural language processing, statistical reasoning, theory, robotics, as well as applications of AI to other domains such as health and education, and submissions concerning fairness, ethics, and transparency in AI. Papers may introduce new theory, methodology, or applications.

We also welcome position papers and demos related to these areas. Work may be previously published, completed, or ongoing. Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 2 reviewers in the area. The workshop will not publish proceedings. We encourage all Black researchers in the field to submit their work, and do not need to be first author of the work. 

### Formatting instructions
All submissions must be in PDF format. Submissions are limited to two content pages, including all figures and tables. An additional page containing only references is allowed.​ Submissions should be in a​ __single column__ ​, typeset using __​11-point__ or larger fonts and have at least ​1-inch margin all around. Submissions that __do not__ follow these guidelines risk being rejected without consideration of their merits. We encourage authors to use one of these templates to prepare their submission:

### Double-blinded reviews
Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 2 reviewers, in addition to an area chair. The reviewing process will be double-blinded at the level of the reviewers. As an author, you are responsible for anonymizing your submission. Do not include your or your co-authors names, affiliations or any other information that might help reviewers to indentify you or your co-authors. 

### Content guidelines
Submissions must state the research problem, motivation, and contribution. Submission must be self-contained and include all figures, tables, and references.

The following link provides sample papers from previous Black in AI workshops: [sample papers](https://github.com/blackinai/blackinai.github.io/tree/master/papers)


### Rebuttals
During the rebuttal phase, the authors will have the opportunity to respond to reviewers questions and comments. Authors will also have the opportunity to update their submission according to reviewer's recommendations. After the update, the paper should follow the submission guidelines described above.
