# Call for Submissions

We invite submissions for the Fourth Black in AI Workshop (Virtual) Workshop (co-located with [NeurIPS 2020](https://nips.cc/). Both the Black in AI workshop and the NeurIPS conference will be held in a virtual (online) format.

We welcome research papers, position papers, survey papers, vision papers, or papers that inform about neglected/abandoned areas of study where AI
could be impactful. Papers may introduce new theory, methodology, applications or product demonstrations. Papers are published in a non-archival format and may have been published in other venues before or be published in other venues in the future.

Submissions may include, but are not limited to, the following topics: Artificial Intelligence, Computational Neuroscience, Deep Learning, Knowledge Reasoning, Machine Learning, Multi-agent Systems, Statistical Reasoning, Computational Theory, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Data
Mining and, Robotics. We also welcome papers about applications of AI to Health, Education, Fairness, Ethics and, Transparency in AI, AI & Arts, AI
& Politics, etc.

Each submission will fall into one of these 4 tracks:

* Machine learning Algorithms
* Systems and Applications
* Position papers
* Product demonstrations

Work may be previously published, completed, or ongoing. The workshop will not publish proceedings. We encourage all Black researchers in areas
related to AI to submit their work. The work should include at least one Black researcher either as main author or co-author.

For further details on the paper submissions please refer to [Submissions](../submissions/) page.

### Invited talks 
The workshop will feature invited talks from prominent researchers and practitioners, oral presentations, and a poster session.
